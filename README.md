# Conectric USB Gateway Module for Node.js

![Conectric USB Router](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Conectric/conectric-usb-gateway/master/usbstick.jpg)

## Introduction

This module is Conectric's Node.js SDK that allows you to communicate with our wireless mesh network sensors.  We aim to get you up and running quickly, so that you can rapidly build applications or visualizations that use near real time temperature, humidity, motion detection and switch state data.  You can also use this module to communicate with devices that use the [RS-485 protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485).

Our introductory video provides a quick overview of the product.

[![Introductory Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Conectric/conectric-usb-gateway/master/video.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPfZNUkFKBM)

We also published an [overview on Medium](https://medium.com/conectric-networks/announcing-conectrics-usb-iot-gateway-sensor-product-86087af7ae57).

## Hardware Requirements

In order to use this module, you will require:

* A computer which has a spare USB 2.0 port.
* The ability to install Node.js 8.9.4 or higher.  We recommend use of the long term stable releases.
* A USB router from Conectric.
* One or more wireless sensors from Conectric.

### USB Router

The USB router is a USB 2.0 stick that can be purchased from Conectric.  It acts as the interface between the mesh network that the sensors are connected to, and this Node module.  

### Sensors

In order to receive data via the USB router through this module, you will need at least one Conectric wireless sensor.  

The following sensor types are supported at this time:

  * Motion (PIR) sensor.
  * Switch (door switch) sensor.
  * Combined temperature / humidity sensor.
  * Wireless RS-485 module.

## Linux Dependencies

If you are running Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) you will need to install the following before installing this module:

```
sudo apt install libusb-dev libusb libudev-dev libudev build-essential
```

You may need to use `apt-get` in place of `apt`, depending on your setup.  You may also need to request specific versions for some e.g. on Raspbian Stretch for Raspberry Pi:

```
sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev build-essential
```

## Node.js Version

We recommend that you use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 8.9.4, or any subsequent long term stable (LTS) release.

## Quick Start

To get going and receive your first sensor data quickly, use one of our bundled examples:

```shell
mkdir iotgateway
cd iotgateway
npm init
```

Accept all the defaults, except "entry point", use `server.js` for that.  Then:

```shell
npm install --save conectric-usb-gateway
cp node_modules/conectric-usb-gateway/examples/logmessages/server.js .
npm start
```

Then insert batteries into your Conectric sensors, plug your Conectric USB router into a USB port on your computer and watch sensor data appear in your `console.log` output.

**Example expected output (when a temperature / humidity sensor is present):**

```shell
$ npm start

> conectric-gateway-example-logmessages@1.0.0 start /Users/conectric/projects/myiotgateway
> node server.js

```

`server.js` contains:

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');

gateway.runGateway({
  onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
    console.log(sensorMessage);
  }
});
```
## Incoming Message Types

This module works by decoding sensor broadcast messages from the mesh network, then translating them into JSON objects which are then supplied to your callback function where your business logic happens.

Depending on how you configure this module (see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) for details), and on which sensors you have available, you can expect to see the following types of message delivered to your callback. 

Each message has a set of common keys.  Others only appear when certain gateway configuration values are set in your code's call to `runGateway`:

* `numHops`: (present if `sendHopData` option is set to `true`).  Value will be a number indicating the number of network hops that the message took.
* `maxHops`: (present if `sendHopData` option is set to `true`).   Value will be a number indicating the maximum number of allowed network hops (`0` = unlimited).
* `payload`: (present unless `sendDecodedPayload` option is set to `false`).  Value will be an object whose schema varies depending on the value of `type`, see the next few sections for examples of each type of payload.
* `timestamp`: (always present) UNIX timestamp for when the gateway received the message from the mesh network.
* `rawData`: (present if `sendRawData` option is set to `true`).  Value will be the raw hex data for the message as received from the mesh network.  This is mostly useful for debugging this module, end users should use values from `payload`.
* `sensorId`: (always present) The last 4 characters of the mesh network MAC address of the sensor that send the message.
* `sequenceNumber`: (always present) The message sequence number -- do not rely on these to arrive in order, or be unique, as the sequence number will reset over time or if the sensor's battery is removed and replaced.  You should **not** use a combination of `sequenceNumber` and `sensorId` as a unique message key.
* `type`: (always present) indicates which type of message was received, values are:
    * `boot`
    * `keepAlive`
    * `motion`
    * `rs485Config`
    * `rs485ChunkEnvelopeResponse`,
    * `rs485ChunkRequest`,
    * `rs485ChunkResponse`,
    * `rs485Request`
    * `rs485Response`
    * `switch`
    * `tempHumidity`
    * `text`

### boot

This message is sent when a sensor initially boots up (battery is inserted), or is reset for some reason.  The message JSON looks like:

```json
{
  "type": "boot",
  "payload": {
    "battery": 2.9,
    "resetCause": "powerOn"
  },
  "timestamp": 1518746384048,
  "sensorId": "a946",
  "sequenceNumber": 0
}
```

The `payload` for the `boot` message consists of the following keys:

* `battery`: The sensor's battery level in volts.
* `resetCause`: Indicates the reason that the sensor booted, possible values are:
    * `powerOn`: The battery was inserted into the sensor.
    * `externalReset`: The sensor's reset button was pressed.
    * `watchdogReset`: The sensor's firmware detected a need to reboot the sensor.
    * `unknown`: Catch all value, which should never appear.

If your application does not need to see these messages, they can be suppressed using the `sendBootMessages` configuration option.  See the [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) for details.

### keepAlive

This message is sent periodically by sensors to indicate that they are still alive.  For example, without a door being opened or closed a switch sensor may not need to send an event message for a very long time, so a `keepAlive` serves as proof that it is still listening, has battery and is attached to the network.

The message JSON looks like this:

```json
{ 
  "type": "keepAlive",
  "payload": { 
    "battery": 3.1 
  },
  "timestamp": 1531977054,
  "sensorId": "15f0",
  "sequenceNumber": 26 
}
```

Delivery of these messages to the callback function is disabled by default.  If your application needs to receive them, they can be enabled using the `sendKeepAliveMessages` configuration option. See the [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) for details. 

### motion

This message is sent when a motion detector / PIR sensor detects motion.  The message JSON looks like:

```json
{ 
  "type": "motion",
  "payload": { 
    "battery": 2.8, 
    "motion": true 
  },
  "timestamp": 1518757698977,
  "sensorId": "02A2",
  "sequenceNumber": 12 
}
```

The `payload` for the `motion` message consists of the following keys:

* `battery`: The sensor's battery level in volts.
* `motion`: Will always be `true` as the sensor only fires when motion is detected.

### rs485ChunkEnvelopeResponse

This message is sent in response to an `rs485Request` message, in the case where the data being return is > 64 bytes and has been split up for tranport on the mesh network.

This message contains information on the number and size of chunks that the data was brokwn down into.

The message JSON looks like:

```json
{ 
  "type": "rs485ChunkEnvelopeResponse",
  "payload": { 
    "battery": 3.1, 
    "numChunks": 4, 
    "chunkSize": 64 
  },
  "timestamp": 1536903474,
  "sensorId": "e17b",
  "sequenceNumber": 39 
}
```
The `payload` for the `rs485ChunkEnvelopeResponse` message consists of the following keys:

* `battery`: The sensor's battery level in volts.
* `numChunks`: The number of chunks that the complete response payload has been broken up into.
* `chunkSize`: The size in bytes of each chunk.

Information from the payload would then be used to send `rs485ChunkRequest` messages to ask the remote device to send each chunk across the network until all are received and can be re-assembled into the original message.

### rs485ChunkResponse

This message is sent in response to an `rs485ChunkRequest` message, and contains a single chunk of a larger complete response that was broken down for transport over the mesh network.

The message JSON looks like:

```json
{
  "type": "rs485ChunkResponse",
  "payload": { 
    "battery": 3.1,
    "data": "021022173..." 
  },
  "timestamp": 1536903735,
  "sensorId": "e17b",
  "sequenceNumber": 45 
}
```
The `payload` for the `rs485ChunkResponse` message consists of the following keys:

* `battery`: The sensor's battery level in volts.
* `data`: Raw data from the device sending the message.

### rs485Response

This message is sent from a wireless RS-485 module in reponse to a request sent from the USB router to the RS-485 module.  See RS-485 Messaging section of this document for details of how to send a request.

The message JSON looks like:

```json
{ 
  "type": "rs485Response",
  "payload": { 
    "battery": 3.1, 
    "rs485": "0110000062b9fe" 
  },
  "timestamp": 1527654307,
  "sensorId": "dfbc",
  "sequenceNumber": 1
}
```

The `payload` for the `rs485Response` message consists of the following keys:

* `battery`: The sensor's battery level in volts.
* `rs485`: Data coming back from the RS-485 device in response to data sent in an `rs485Request` message (See RS-485 Messaging section of this document).  The format and encoding of this data will depend on your RS-485 device.

### switch

This messsage is sent when a switch / door switch sensor changes state (switch / door opens or closes).  The message JSON looks like:

```json
{ 
  "type": "switch",
  "payload": { 
    "battery": 3, 
    "switch": false 
  },
  "timestamp": 1518757698977,
  "sensorId": "0219",
  "sequenceNumber": 0 
}
```

The `payload` for the `switch` message consists of the following keys:

* `battery`: The sensor's battery level in volts.
* `switch`: By default, the value will be `false` when the two switch magnets are close to each other or `true` when the two switch magnets are far apart from each other.

The optional configuration key `switchOpenValue` can be used in your call to `runGateway`.  It can be set to change the value of `switch`, so that it becomes `false` when the magnets are far apart from each other and `true` when they are close together.  To do this, set `switchOpenValue` to `false` in your call to `runGateway`:

```javascript
gateway.runGateway({
  onSensorData: (sensorData) => {
    console.log(sensorData);
  },
  switchOpenValue: false  // switch messages report true when magnets close to each other
})
```

### tempHumidity

This message is sent when a temperature and humidity sensor broadcasts the temperature and humidity values that it has observed.  The message JSON looks like:

```json
{
  "type": "tempHumidity",
  "payload": {
    "battery": 3,
    "temperature": 73.33,
    "temperatureUnit": "F",
    "humidity": 60.65
  },
  "timestamp": 1518746385455,
  "sensorId": "a946",
  "sequenceNumber": 1
}
```

The `payload` for the `tempHumidity` message consists of the following keys:

* `battery`: The sensor's battery level in volts.
* `temperature`: The temperature reading, to a maximum of two decimal places.
* `temperatureUnit`: Will be set to `"C"` if the value of `temperature` is in degrees Celcius (default), or `"F"` if the value of `temperature` is in degrees Fahrenheit.
* `humidity`: The percentage relative humidity reading, to a maximum of two decimal places.

By default, values for `temperature` will be in degrees Celcius.  To receive values in degrees Fahrenheit, set the configuration option `useFahrenheightTemps` to `true` (see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) section).

### text

This message is received from another USB router or other network device.  The message JSON looks like:

```json
{ 
  "type": "text",
  "payload": { 
    "battery": 3.2, 
    "text": "Hello World this is a test." 
  },
  "timestamp": 1524198664,
  "sensorId": "da40",
  "sequenceNumber": 10 
}
```

The `payload` for the `text` message consists of the following keys:

* `battery`: The sensor's battery level in volts.
* `text`: The free text message string that was sent (up to 250 characters).

By default, `text` will be decoded from the hex representation used on the network.  To receive raw hex data instead, set the configuration option `decodeTextMessages` to `false` (see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) section).

## Callback Functions

This module deals with decoding the sensor broadcast messages from the mesh network, and handles all of the heavy lifting associated with that for you.  When you start the gateway module by invoking its `runGateway` method, you must pass it a configuration object containing a callback function that will be called every time a message is received from the mesh network.  A second callback function can also be supplied, and is called when the gateway is ready to send text messages to the network.

You can disable some messages (for example sensor boot messages) using the configuration settings (see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) section) in the case where your business logic doesn't need to see them.

### onSensorData

The object passed to the `runGateway` method must contain a key `onSensorData` whose value must be a function that takes a single parameter.  Values passed to that parameter will be JSON objects corresponding to the schemas described in [Message Types](#message-types).

Here's an example implementation that can process several types of incoming message and display relevant data:

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');

gateway.runGateway({
  onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
    const sensorId = sensorMessage.sensorId;
    const payload = sensorMessage.payload;

    switch (sensorMessage.type) {
      case 'boot':
        console.log(`Sensor ${sensorId} booted, reason ${payload.resetCause}`);
        break;
      case 'motion':
        console.log(`Sensor ${sensorId} detected motion.`);
        break;
      case 'tempHumidity':
        console.log(`Sensor ${sensorId} reports temp ${payload.temperature}${payload.temperatureUnit} / humidity ${payload.humidity}%.`);
        break;
      case 'switch':
        console.log(`Sensor ${sensorId}, switch state is ${payload.switch}.`);
        break;
      default:
        console.log('Unknown message type received!');
    }
  }  
});
```

### onGatewayReady

This is an optional callback that should be provided if you want to know when the USB router has been inserted and the gateway has established communications with it and is ready to send messages.  Use this if you wish to use the text message sending or RS-485 functionality.

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');

gateway.runGateway({
    onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
        console.log(sensorMessage);
    },
    onGatewayReady: () => {
        console.log('Gateway is ready.');
        const res = gateway.sendTextMessage({
            message: 'Hello World this is a test.',
            destination: 'da40'
        });

        console.log(`${res === true ? 'Message sent.' : 'Error sending message.'}`);
    }
});
```

If you want to broadcast the text message to any listening routers, use `gateway.BROADCAST_ALL_ADDRESS` as the destination value.  To broadcast to those a single network hop away, use `gateway.BROADCAST_LOCAL_ADDRESS`.

## Configuration Options

The object that is passed as the only parameter to the `runGateway` method can also contain any mixture of the following additional configuration keys.  Adding additional keys that are not documented here will result in an error message from `runGateway`.

Example with some configuration options set, those which are omitted will use their default values:

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');

gateway.runGateway({
  onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
    console.log(sensorMessage);
  },
  sendBootMessages: false, // Suppress sensor boot/reboot messages
  useFahrenheitTemps: true // Report temperature in F not C
});
```

### debugMode

Controls whether or not additional low level debugging is sent to `console.log` (informational) and `console.error` (error) from within the gateway module.

* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: `false`

### decodeTextMessages

Controls whether or not text message payloads are decoded from hex.

* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: `true`

### deDuplicateBursts

Some sensors broadcast messages in a burst, where the same message ID is sent more than once to ensure that it reaches its indended recipient.  This parameter controls whether the gateway module should pass all messages having the same messsage ID to the `onSensorData` callback or only one of them.  Applies to all message types.

* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: `true`

### sendBootMessages

Sensors broadcast boot messages when a battery is inserted or other power reset event occurs.  This parameter controls whether or not these messages are passed to the `onSensorData` callback.

* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: `true`

### sendDecodedPayload

If `true`, messages supplied to the `onSensorData` callback will contain a `payload` key containing a JSON object that holds the decoded message payload.  The form of this object will depend on which type of message was received (see [Message Types](#message-types)).

* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: `true`

### sendHopData

If `true`, messages supplied to the `onSensorData` callback will contain two extra keys:

* `numHops`: The number of wireless hops that the message took across the network
* `maxHops`: The maximum number of hops that the network allows (0 = unlimited)
* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: `false`

### sendKeepAliveMessages

If `true`, `keepAlive` messages will be passed to the `onSensorData` callback. 

* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: false

### sendRawData

If `true`, messages supplied to the `onSensorData` callback will contain a `rawData` key containing the unencoded hex message received from the mesh network.  Mostly useful for debugging the gateway module.

* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: `false`

### switchOpenValue

Determines whether the library reports the switch sensor having an open circuit as `true` or `false`.  Set according to your application's needs.

* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: `false`

### useFahrenheitTemps

If `true`, messages of type `tempHumidity` will contain temperature in Fahrenheit.  If `false`, messages of type `tempHumidity` will contain temperature in Celcius.

* Possible values: `true | false`
* Optional: yes
* Default: `false`

## Getting the Gateway's MAC Address

Should you need to access the mesh network MAC address for the USB router that the gateway module is using, you can do so in your callback function as follows:

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');

gateway.runGateway({
  onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
    console.log(gateway.macAddress); // '00124b0005141c71'
    console.log(sensorMessage);
  }
});
```

The MAC address is returned as a string.  This could for example be useful to use in a message that your callback function sends to a server, so that the originating gateway can be identified if your system has several of them.

## Getting Version Information from the Gateway

Should you need to know the gateway's Contiki OS version or Conectric firmware version, you can do so in your callback function as follows:

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');

gateway.runGateway({
  onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
    console.log(gateway.contikiVersion); // '3.x'
    console.log(gateway.conectricVersion); // '1.0.2'
    console.log(sensorMessage);
  }
});
```

## Sending a Text Message

To send a text message to another USB router, you will need to know the last 4 characters of that router's MAC address (see above for how to obtain this).

Once you have that, simply call `sendTextMessage`:

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');

gateway.runGateway({
    onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
        console.log(sensorMessage);
    },
    onGatewayReady: () => {
        console.log('Gateway is ready.');
        const res = gateway.sendTextMessage({
            message: 'Hello World this is a test.',
            destination: 'da40'
        });

        console.log(`${res === true ? 'Message sent.' : 'Error sending message.'}`);
    }
});
```

This requires the gateway to be up and running, so should be called only once the `onGatewayReady` callback has been invoked.  If you want to broadcast the text message to any listening routers, use `gateway.BROADCAST_ALL_ADDRESS` as the destination value.  Use `gateway.BROADCAST_LOCAL_ADDRESS` to broadcast to local neighboring devices only.

Both `message` and `destination` are required parameters.

## RS-485 Messaging

Using Conectric's wireless RS-485 module, messages can be exchanged with devices that use the RS-485 protocol.

### Sending an RS-485 Configuration Message

This message is used to configure serial communications with the RS-485 device attached to the wireless RS-485 module.

The following parameters are all required when using `sendRS485ConfigMessage`:

* `baudRate`: Valid values are `2400`, `4800`, `9600`, `19200`.
* `parity`: Valid values are `gateway.PARITY_NONE`, `gateway.PARITY_ODD` and `gateway.PARITY_EVEN`.
* `stopBits`: Valid values are `1` and `2`.
* `bitMask`: Valid values are `8` and `7`.
* `destination`: The last 4 characters of the MAC address of the device that the message is destined for e.g. `da40`. 

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');

gateway.runGateway({
    onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
        console.log(sensorMessage);
    },
    onGatewayReady: () => {
        console.log('Gateway is ready.');
        const res = gateway.sendRS485ConfigMessage({
          baudRate: 4800,
          parity: gateway.PARITY_NONE,
          stopBits: 1,
          bitMask: 7,
          destination: 'da40'
        });

        console.log(`${res === true ? 'Message sent.' : 'Error sending message.'}`);
    }
});
```

This requires the gateway to be up and running, so should be called only once the `onGatewayReady` callback has been invoked.  If you want to broadcast the text message to any listening routers, use `gateway.BROADCAST_ALL_ADDRESS` as the destination value.  Use `gateway.BROADCAST_LOCAL_ADDRESS` to broadcast to local neighboring devices only.

### Sending an RS-485 Request Message

This message is used to send data to an RS-485 device connected to a Conectric RS-485 wireless module.  

The following parameters are required:

* `message`: A string of data to be sent to the RS-485 device.  The format / encoding of this data will depend on your RS-485 device.

And the following are optional parameters:

* `hexEncodePayload`: If set to `true`, the value of `message` will be hex encoded before being sent to the wireless RS-485 module.  If set to `false`, the value of `message` will be sent unchanged.  Defaults to `true`.

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');
  
gateway.runGateway({
  onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
    console.log(sensorMessage);
  },
  onGatewayReady: () => {
    console.log('Gateway is ready.');
    gateway.sendRS485Request({
      message: '010600000001480a',
      destination: 'dfbc',
      hexEncodePayload: false
    });
  }
});

```

(Sends `010600000001480a` to RS-485 wireless module whose MAC address ends `dfbc`).

This requires the gateway to be up and running, so should be called only once the `onGatewayReady` callback has been invoked.  If you want to broadcast the text message to any listening routers, use `gateway.BROADCAST_ALL_ADDRESS` as the destination value.  Use `gateway.BROADCAST_LOCAL_ADDRESS` to broadcast to local neighboring devices only.

### Receiving an RS-485 Response Message

`rs485Response` messages arrive into the `onSensorMessage` callback function like any other messages from sensors:

```javascript
const gateway = require('conectric-usb-gateway');

gateway.runGateway({
    onSensorMessage: (sensorMessage) => {
        if (sensorMessage.messageType === 'rs485Response') {
          console.log(sensorMessage.payload.rs485);
        }
    },
    onGatewayReady: () => {
        console.log('Gateway is ready.');
        // Send an rs485 message here...
    }
});
```

The data from the RS-485 device will be contained in `sensorMessage.payload.rs485`.  The data's encoding will depend on the RS-485 device.

### Receiving a Chunked RS-485 Response Message

When sending an `rs485Request`, the response may sometimes contain a data payload that is too large to be transmitted over the mesh network in a single message.  In this case the RS-485 sensor will break it down into chunks.  Instead of replying with an `rs485Response` message, it will reply with a `rs485ChunkEnvelopeResponse`.  This message contains details of how many chunks are needed to transmit the message, and what the size of each chunk is:

```json
{ 
  "type": "rs485ChunkEnvelopeResponse",
  "payload": { 
    "battery": 3.1, 
    "numChunks": 4, 
    "chunkSize": 64 
  },
  "timestamp": 1536903474,
  "sensorId": "e17b",
  "sequenceNumber": 39 
}
```

Using the values in `payload.numChunks` and `payload.chunkSize`, you can then send an `rs485ChunkRequest` message back to the RS-485 sensor for the first chunk (chunks are 0 indexed, so to get 4 we would use 0-3):

```javascript
    gateway.sendRS485ChunkRequest({
        chunkNumber: 0,
        chunkSize: msg.payload.chunkSize,
        destination: msg.sensorId
    });
```

The RS-485 sensor will respond with a `rs485ChunkResponse` message which looks like this and contains the first part of the data:

```json
{
  "type": "rs485ChunkResponse",
  "payload": { 
    "battery": 3.1,
    "data": "021022173..." 
  },
  "timestamp": 1536903735,
  "sensorId": "e17b",
  "sequenceNumber": 45 
}
```

You would then repeat this process for chunks 1..3 and once all 4 chunks are retrieved, you can assemble the complete data packet.

While sending and receiving `rs485ChunkRequest` and `rs485ChunkResponse` messages, you should **not** send another `rs485Request` to the same sensor, as this will cause it to exit the chunking process on its side, and begin a new request/response cycle.

Full demo code for this process can be found in `examples/ekm`.

## Bundled Examples

To get you started quickly, we have provided some basic example implementations that use the gateway module.  These are located in the `examples` folder.

### Example 1: Log Incoming Messages

**Location:** `examples/logmessages`.

**Sensors Required:** Any.

**Description:** This is the simplest example, which uses all the configuration defaults and simply logs each message received.

**Usage:** To run this example, use follow these simple steps:

```shell
mkdir iotgateway
cd iotgateway
npm init
```

Accept all the defaults, except "entry point", use `server.js` for that.  Then:

```shell
npm install --save conectric-usb-gateway
cp node_modules/conectric-usb-gateway/examples/logmessages/server.js .
npm start
```

Then insert the Conectric USB router into a free USB port, and add batteries to your sensors.

If you want to modify this example for your own purposes, simply edit `server.js` and replace the contents of the callback function with your own logic.

### Example 2: Send Incoming Messages to a Server

**Location:** `examples/sendmessages`.

**Sensors Required:** Any.

**Description:** This is a basic example showing how to receive messages from the mesh network and pass them to a server via HTTP POST to a URL.  It uses the popular [request module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) to manage the HTTP communications.  You can make this work simply by editing the URL to match your needs then implementing some server side logic to receive the JSON messages and do as you please with them.

**Usage:** To run this example, follow these simple steps:

```shell
mkdir iotgateway
cd iotgateway
npm init
```

Accept all the defaults, except "entry point", use `server.js` for that.  Then:

```shell
npm install --save conectric-usb-gateway
npm install --save request
cp node_modules/conectric-usb-gateway/examples/sendmessages/server.js .
npm start
```

Insert the Conectric USB stick into your computer.  After a short while you should see messages from any Conectric sensors that are nearby arriving on your computer and being sent to the server URL.

### Example 3: Send a Text Message to Another USB Router

**Location:** `examples/textmessage`.

**Sensors Required:** No sensors, requires two USB routers.

**Description:** This example shows how to send a text message betweeen two routers.

**Usage:** Before setting up this example, you will need to know the last 4 characters of the MAC address of the other USB router that will receive your message.  When you have this, store it in an environment variable:

* `DESTINATION_ROUTER_ADDR`, set to the last 4 characters of the receiving USB router's MAC address e.g. `da40`.

Once the environment variable has been set, follow these steps to install dependencies and set up npm:

```shell
mkdir iotgateway
cd iotgateway
npm init
```

Accept all the defaults, except "entry point", use `server.js` for that.  Then:

```shell
npm install --save conectric-usb-gateway
cp node_modules/conectric-usb-gateway/examples/textmessage/server.js .
```

Don't start the gateway yet, we need to set up the second one first... On another computer, follow the instructions to set up Example 1: Log Incoming Messages.  Start the message logging example code, and insert the USB router whose MAC address ends with the `DESTINATION_ROUTER_ADDR` that was set on the first computer.

Once the second computer reports that it is ready to receive messages, start the gateway on the first one:

```shell
npm start
```

It should start up and send the message:

```shell
> npm start

Waiting for USB router device.
USB Router device attached.
Found USB router device at /dev/tty.usbserial-DB00VL5G.
Gateway opened.
Switched gateway to dump payload mode.
USB router mac address is 00124b000513da7f.
USB router Contiki version: 3.x
USB router Conectric version: 1.0.2
Switched gateway to sink mode.
Gateway is ready.
Message sent.
```

And the second computer should report receipt of the message, decode it and log it:

```javascript
{ type: 'text',
  payload: { 
    battery: 3.2, 
    text: 'Hello World this is a test.' 
  },
  timestamp: 1524285294,
  sensorId: 'ffff',
  sequenceNumber: 0 
}
```

### Example 4: Exchange RS-485 Messages with Another USB Router

An RS-485 example will be provided in a future release.

### Example 5: Send an SMS Message Via Twilio API When A Door Opens

**Location:** `examples/twiliosms`.

**Sensors Required:** Switch.

**Description:** This example uses the door (switch) sensor.  Whenever the door is opened (sensor reports `true`), the callback function uses the [Twilio SMS API](https://www.twilio.com/sms) to send a text message to a pre-determined phone number which is set via an environment variable.

In order to use this, you will need to [sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) for a Twilio demo account, or use your own paid account if you have one.

**Usage:** Before setting up this example, you will need to get all of the following from Twilio:

* Account SID.
* Authentication Token.
* Phone Number.
* If using their trial, set up your cell phone's number as a verified number on the account.

Once you've done that, set some environment variables on your local machine:

* `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, set to your Twilio Account SID.
* `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, set to your Twilio Authentication Token.
* `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, set to your Twilio Account's phone number (the one that SMS messages will appear to have come from).
* `TWILIO_DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER`, set to the phone number you wish to send the SMS messages to (for trial accounts this must be a verified phone number with Twilio).

Once the environment variables have been set, follow these steps to install dependencies and set up npm:

```shell
mkdir iotgateway
cd iotgateway
npm init
```

Accept all the defaults, except "entry point", use `server.js` for that.  Then:

```shell
npm install --save conectric-usb-gateway
npm install --save twilio
cp node_modules/conectric-usb-gateway/examples/twiliosms/server.js .
npm start
```

Insert the Conectric USB stick into your computer and turn on any door sensors.  Once you open the door sensor (magnets apart) you should expect to see an SMS API call to Twilio which should trigger a text message to the phone whose number is set in `TWILIO_DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER`.

We also published an overview of how to set up and use this example as an [article on Medium](https://medium.com/conectric-networks/door-open-alerts-with-twilio-and-conectrics-iot-sensor-product-for-node-js-65d67db97584).


### Example 6: Post Motion Events to a Slack Channel At A Configurable Minimum Interval

**Location:** `examples/slackmotion`.

**Sensors Required:** Motion.

**Description:** This example receives messages from motion sensors, and will report motion events to the popular collaboration / chat platform [Slack](https://slack.com) after a configurable minimum time interval has passed since the last event.

**Usage:** Before starting up this example, you will need to get an incoming webhook URL from Slack for the Slack team that you wish to use.  See the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) for details of how to do so.

Once you have obtained your Slack webhook URL, go ahead and set the following environment variables on your local machine:

* `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, set to the full URL that you got from Slack.
* `MOTION_REPORTING_CHANNEL`, set to the name of the Slack channel that you'd like messages posted to e.g. `random`.  You don't need the leading `#` in the channel name here.
* `MOTION_REPORTING_INTERVAL`, set the to minumum number of seconds that you'd like to have elapsed between motion events being sent to Slack e.g. `60` = 1 minute.

Having set the environment variables, follow these steps to install dependencies and set up npm:

```shell
mkdir iotgateway
cd iotgateway
npm init
```

Accept all the defaults, except "entry point", use `server.js` for that.  Then:

```shell
npm install --save conectric-usb-gateway
npm install --save slack-node
cp node_modules/conectric-usb-gateway/examples/slackmotion/server.js .
npm start
```

Insert the Conectric USB stick into your computer then insert the batteries into your motion sensor(s).  Trigger a motion sensor by waving at it, which should cause a motion event to be reported in your Slack channel.  Subsequent messages will be sent to Slack when motion is detected if `TEMPERATURE_REPORTING_INTERVAL` seconds or more have passed since the last motion event was seen.

We also published an overview of how to set up and use this example as an [article on Medium](https://medium.com/conectric-networks/movement-alerts-in-slack-with-conectrics-motion-sensor-iot-gateway-for-node-js-fcc77529e210).

### Example 7: Post Temperature Data to Elasticsearch

**Location:** `examples/elastic`.

**Sensors Required:** Temperature.

**Description:** This example receives messages from the mesh network, and reformats temperature/humidity sensor messages to flat JSON objects that it then sends to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).  Objects are placed into an index called `temphumidityreadings` which is created for you if not found.

In order to use this, you will need to download and setup Elasticsearch, or use their [cloud hosted solution](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/as-a-service).  You could also use additional tools such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to visualize the data.  Grafana is also available to download, or as a cloud hosted service.

**Usage:** Before starting up this example, you will need to:

* Install Elasticsearch somewhere (locally, on a server, or use the hosted cloud trial).
* Know the URL and port that your Elasticsearch is running on.
* Know your Elasticsearch user name (often `elastic`) and password.

Once you have all of these things, set some environment variables on your local machine:

* `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`, set to the Elasticsearch URL minus the port information.  Must begin `http://` or `https://` e.g. `https://elasticsearch.mydomain.com`.
* `ELASTICSEARCH_USER`, set to the Elasticsearch user's username e.g. `elastic`.
* `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`, set to the Elasticsearch user's password.
* `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`, set to the port that Elasticsearch is running on e.g. `9243`.

Once the environment variables have been set, follow these steps to install dependencies and set up npm:

```shell
mkdir iotgateway
cd iotgateway
npm init
```

Accept all the defaults, except "entry point", use `server.js` for that.  Then:

```shell
npm install --save conectric-usb-gateway
npm install --save elasticsearch
cp node_modules/conectric-usb-gateway/examples/elastic/server.js .
npm start
```

Insert the Conectric USB stick into your computer.  After a short while you should see temperature and humidity readings appear in Elasticsearch from any Conectric temperature sensors that you have nearby.

We also published an overview of how to set up and use this example as an [article on Medium](https://medium.com/conectric-networks/visualizing-room-climate-data-with-conectrics-iot-sensors-elasticsearch-grafana-3254265bf35a).

### Example 8: Receiving Chunked RS-485 Messages

**Location:** `examples/ekm`.

**Sensors Required:** RS-485 plus EKM Omnimeter v3 or v4.

**Description:** This example demonstrates how to read data from EKM's Omnimeter sub-metering product using the RS-485 data chunking messages.  It supports two different versions of the meter.  With the v3 meter, all of the data can be read in a single request / chunked response cycle.  The v4 meter provides more data, and required two request / chunked response cycles.

Both v3 and v4 demos return raw data from the meter, which would need further decoding according to EKM's documentation.

**Usage:** Before starting up this example, you will need to:

* Have an EKM Omnimeter (version 3 or 4).
* Connect the meter to the RS-485 sensor.

Next setup the code:

```shell
mkdir ekmmeter
cd ekmmeter
npm init
```

Accept all the defaults, except "entry point", use `server.js` for that.  Then:

```shell
npm install --save conectric-usb-gateway
```

If you have a v3 meter:

```shell
cp node_modules/conectric-usb-gateway/examples/ekm/omnimeter-v3/server.js .
```

If using a v4 meter, do this instead:

```shell
node_modules/conectric-usb-gateway/examples/ekm/omnimeter-v4/server.js .
```

Then edit `server.js`, replacing `dfbc` with the 4 character MAC address of your RS-485 sensor.  Also set the value of the constant `METER_SERIAL_NUMBER_HEX` with the encoded serial number for your meter.

To work out your meter's encoded serial number, take each digit of the serial number including leading 0's and put a 3 in front of it.  For example 0 becomes 30, 2 becomes 32 up to 9 becoming 39.

Having done that and saved your changes, start the demo:

```shell
npm start
```

Insert the Conectric USB stick into your computer.  You should see the code recognize this and send a message to read the meter, logging the reply.

We have also produced [a separate demo](https://github.com/Conectric/node-ekm-meter-demo) that decodes the reply into a JavaScript object.

## Power Management Tips

If your application requires continuous data gathering, you should ensure that the various power saving options on the computer that you plug the USB stick into are disabled.  Otherwise, you may find that the computer may sleep the USB ports, causing a gap in your data collection.

## Usage on Raspberry Pi

When using this module on a Raspberry Pi running the Raspbian operating system, we recommend using Raspbian Stretch Lite.  Installation on Raspbian (Desktop or Lite edition) will require some additional steps to install a more up to date version of Node and additional packages required to enable USB support in Node.

### Install Node.js

```shell
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Check that Node was correctly installed:

```shell
npm --version
node --version
```

### Install Required Packages for USB

Additional packages need to be installed to add USB support:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
```
